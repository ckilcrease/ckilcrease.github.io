            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal site! I'm Celina, a 20-year-old student of Computer Science student at New York University. (I am also pursuing a minor in Psychology, which is an area of great interest for me).</p>
            
            <p>My current computer-related goals include improving and expanding my web design/development skills, especially through gaining a better grasp on JavaScript and JQuery. As a result, this website could be considered a work-in-progress. My personal goals include improving my French, as well as regaining my clarinet skills.</p>
            
            <p>On this page, you can also find my skills, projects, and contact information, or you can view my Github account <a href="http://github.com/ckilcrease">here</a>.</p>
